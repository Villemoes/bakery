OpenEmbedded Bakery

Python command

oe setup <conf-file>
	reads configuration from file
	copies to conf/oe.conf
	and checks out bitbake and clones and configures openembedded repository
	must be executed from top-level directory, with existing conf/oe-setup.xml

oe setup bitbake
	only do bitbake part of "oe setup"

oe setup openembedded
	only do openembedded part of "oe setup"
	could also be made able to re-do setup, ie. adding new/missing remotes

all remaining sub-commands do
	reads configuration from conf/oe-setup.xml
	finds it by traversion up, until finding conf/oe-setup.xml

oe downloads|dl ....

oe mirror put <file>*
	upload specified download file(s) to download mirror
	if no files are specified, upload all files
	print warning for all files missing md5 sums
		S: skip file
		r: remove file
		g: generate md5 sum file
	files already present in repository are compared
		local md5 sum is checked first, and print warning if it does not match
			S: skip file
			f: fix MD5 sum
			r: remove file
		if local and remote md5 sums differ, print warning (and MD5 sums) and ask
			S: skip file
			p: put local copy to repository
			g: get repository copy

oe mirror get [file]*
	download specified files from download repository
	if file already exists, they are simply overwritten

oe mirror save <bundle>
	upload list of files to for "bundle" to repository
	also do compare

oe mirror load [--clean] <bundle>*
	download all files in the bundle lists specified
	if --clean is given, remove all other files from local download dir
	if no bundle is specified, default to last bundle(s) specified (commit or update)
	support scp, rsync+ssh, and http/https download

oe mirror compare
	compare local files to copies in download repository,
	reporting any files that are not identical

oe mirror sync [--bundle=<bundle>]
	this should not be implemented: use put + save instead
	bundle sync should be run after a complete build of target image and toolchain(s)
	this should best be called from cron-job, with a preceeding full
	"oe bb -cfetch bootstrap-image meta-toolchain blah blahhhh"
	support rsync+ssh upload

oe bake ....
	build using bitbake
	bitbake version is taken from openembedded/.bitbake file
		which is then tracked by git, and therefore should work

oe status
	print some kind of status report
	oe directory
	current openembedded branch
	size of openembedded repository
	size of and revision of bitbake dir
	currently selected/used bitbake revision/tag/branch
	size of downloads dir
	size of tmp dir (with list of sub-dir sizes also)
	maybe a package arch size display
		ie. for each package arch, total tmp size, tmp/work size,
		tmp/staging size



oe-setup.xml should contain:
bitbake svn url
default bitbake branch/tag/revision
openembedded git server hostname
openembedded git path
openembedded git server local hostname regex (optional, defaults to server hostname)
downloads repository server
downloads repository path
for each remote
	server hostname
	path
	server local hostname regex (optional, defaults to server hostname)
