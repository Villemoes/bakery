OE Bakery ToDo:

fix error message when command fails so that nice commandline string is printed
instead of ugly array/list thingy

oe init --openembedded-remotes
	should add any missing remotes
	and in the future warn about differences

fix adding of remote's by oe init from localhost, so that they are setup as local
remotes instead of ssh remotes.

make oe init more robust to failures, such as often-broken git.openembedded.net

oe config should show which local.conf is currently selected

extend oe config to support branch switching also
	default branch setting should be supported in the local.conf.d/ files

extend oe config with command line arguments for local.conf and branch selection
	oe config gallega	- should select local.conf.d/gallega and branch if specified
	oe config --no-branch-switch gallega
	oe config --branch=org.openembedded.dev gallega

oe status
	which branch is checked out
	is it clean
	which bitbake is used
	where is tmpdir
	what local.conf is used
	what is the size of current tmpdir
	what is the size of all other tmpdirs

try to use recommended python versions (fx. 2.5 for bitbake-1.8.10)

release 1.0

oe put/get
	simple upload / download of files to/from downloads mirror

python distutils

debian/ubuntu package and repository

oe mirror compare
