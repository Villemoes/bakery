Release process
===============

This chapter describes how a new release of {bake} is made.

.The steps needed to make a new release are:
- Create temporary release commit
- Run ppa_upload.sh
- Tag the new release in git
- Create tarballs for OE-lite.org
- Upload to PyPi

Create temporary release commit
-------------------------------

First make an initial commit with version and changelog changes for the release.

edit `oebakery/oe.py` and `oebakery/__init__.py and add the new version.

edit `debian/changelog` with info for the new release. Take a look at the previous
release commits to see how to do this.

Run `ppa_upload.sh`
-------------------

First look at: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu under "Active series and milestones"
to check what ubuntu releases are still active. The newest non-LTS release can often
be skipped.

Then edit `ppa_upload.sh`:

`LEAD_DISTRO="trusty" #preferred distro, most likely newest LTS`
`OLD_DISTROES="lucid precise quantal saucy" #the rest of the active releases`

run `ppa_upload.sh`

NOTE: currently requires `~/.dput.cf` and Esbens GPG key.

WARNING: Wait until the PPAs have been created before proceeding to the next step.

Tag the new release in Git
--------------------------

`git tag -a -m 'release 4.2.0' v4.2.0`

Create tarballs for OE-lite.org
-------------------------------

Change directory to the parent directory of the {bake} source:

`git archive --prefix=bakery-4.2.0/ -o oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar v4.2.0`

`cat oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar | gzip > oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar.gz &&
cat oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar | bzip2 > oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar.bz2 &&
cat oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar | xz > oe-lite-bakery-4.2.0.tar.xz`

Upload the tarballs to http://oe-lite.org/download/bakery/

Upload to PyPi
--------------

WARNING: FIXME

TODO
----

Wishes for improved releases process include:

- Figure out if the https://build.opensuse.org/[OpenSuse Open Build Service (OBS)]
could be used to release binaries for more distroes
- Create team/group/project PPA instead of Esbens personal for releases
- Can `debchange` be used to make the changelog edits?
